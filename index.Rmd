You can do what you usually do.

This means you can add text.

This website is an example coming from [P8105](https://p8105.com/index.html). We're making websites today! Learn more about this site [here](about.html).

I also use [google](https://www.google.com/) a ton for ds.

To show that you can use RMD like normal, check out [this page](plots.html) with plots. 


Here's a picture of Ted.
